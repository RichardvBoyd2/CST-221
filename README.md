# CST-221
Git repository for my course work in CST-221

My name is Richard Boyd. I'm 24 years old currently working in the private security industry. I've had a passion for video games and technology my entire life and hope to work as a game engine programmer someday after getting my BS in Computer Programming here at GCU.
